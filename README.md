ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bae Huey
I started learning online marketing in 2020, focusing on copywriting, advertising, and gaining expertise in the field. I ventured into entrepreneurship that year, providing advertising branding design, website development, and video editing services. However, as time was limited, it took several days to complete a single project, leading to cash flow challenges. My initial idea was to combine AI marketing and design. In 2020, there were many online courses available, and I started enrolling in paid courses to enhance my skills.
However, as the pace of the industry accelerated, time became increasingly scarce. I found myself needing to multitask, juggling between case study and research, meeting clients, hiring people, coordinating with partners, managing various tasks, handling work handovers, and even acting as customer service. Eventually, I became physically and mentally exhausted, and I contemplated giving up on entrepreneurship and returning to a regular job.
